# Employment Database Application
This is a web application which provides an employment portal via which an user can apply for the jobs.
It was the final project of my CS 425 (Web App Development) class. This app is an employment portal for special need students
via which they can apply for the jobs that matches their skills set. Once the user launches this app, they are prompted to the login page.
After entering the username and password, the user is prompted to a page where they can add and see skills and jobs. 
Also, it has a logout button to logout. After the user selects the jobs, the pdf file is prompted with the jobs and the skills set of the user for that job.
